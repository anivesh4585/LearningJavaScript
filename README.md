Repository Overview

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This repository contains a collection of basic programming exercises designed to help with foundational learning in programming. The programs cover various topics such as:

    Loops: Examples of different types of loops (for, while, do-while) to iterate through data and perform repetitive tasks.
    Conditionals: Programs demonstrating the use of conditional statements (if, else, switch) to make decisions in the code based on different conditions.
    Arrays: Exercises on using arrays for storing and manipulating collections of data.

This repository is part of my journey to learn programming fundamentals and gain hands-on experience with GitHub. Feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, or use it for your learning purposes!

Run the Programs:

    Each file corresponds to a different programming exercise. Depending on the programming language used, you can run the files using the appropriate interpreter or compiler. For example:

    For Python files (.py):

    bash

python filename.py

Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from python.org.

For JavaScript files (.js):

bash

node filename.js

Ensure Node.js is installed on your system. You can download it from nodejs.org.
